# MAI: Mark's AES67 Implementation

An interface between JACK (jack-audio-connection-kit) and AES67 network audio senders and receivers.

## Getting Started

The program currently compiles on most linux distributions with a standard GCC compiler.  Simply run 'make all'.

### Prerequisites

* JACK (jack-audio-connection-kit)
* libsamplerate 

### Beta Software

This is a beta version.  Although the software functions fairly well and has had moderate testing with itself on 
the loopback interface and on an active switched network with Audinate's Brooklyn II Dante modules in AES67 mode,
it should be thouroughly tested before being used in a production setup.

Development is ongoing and beta testers and contributors are welcome.
