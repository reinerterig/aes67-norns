ptp:
	a mechanism to time ptp delay requests based upon the RTP clock
	instability.  more unstable == more requests,  more stable == 
	less requests.
	
audio:
	a mechanism to monitor the depth of buffered audio and to 
	reduce the buffer by sample slipping when the buffer gets
	above a certain threshold.
	
	the same logic _might_ be applied to the read buffer in order
	to fill in some samples and to smooth buffer-jumps associated
	with network jitter.
